## Accommodation
- [Motel One Munich-Sendlinger Tor](https://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/munich/hotel-munich-sendlinger-tor/). This is located in the city centre close to the Sendlinger Tor underground station.
- [Motel One Munich-Garching](https://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/munich/hotel-munich-garching/). This is located outside the city centre but closer to the conference venue. The Garching-Hochbruck station is right outside the hotel.

## Getting to the venue

By public transport (U-Bahn), the venue can be reached in approximately 30 minutes from the city centre. You need to get off at the last stop of the U6 Line (Garching-Forschungszentrum).

More information is available here

- [Ticket prices](https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/tickets-and-fares/tickets-daytickets/single-day-ticket/index.html). Garching-Forschungzentrum is on the green zone therefore you will need to buy the Munich XXL ticket (8,90 EUR for a single-day ticket).

## Social Activities

Wed. 5 Dec. evening. There will be a talk by [Lisa McShane](https://brb.nci.nih.gov/aboutBRP/lmcshane.htm) at Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) from 5-6pm, followed by a presentation of the [STRATOS](http://www.stratos-initiative.org) initiative. This is an opportunity for the two groups to meet. We plan to go for some beer and food downtown afterward (self-funded).

Thur. 6 Dec. evening we will visit the Christmas market in the city centre and have a dinner party (self-funded) at the brewery [Hofbrauhaus](https://www.hofbraeuhaus.de/en/) afterwards.

Sat. 8 Dec. If the snow condition allows it, some organizers will go skiing in Garmisch, a ski resort near Munich. Everyone is welcome to join. Here some information from last year about a [train & ski-pass offer](https://www.bahn.de/p/view/mdb/bahnintern/angebotsberatung/regio/laender-tickets/pdfs/2017/mdb_260597_garmischer_ski_ticket_2017_18_flyer.pdf). 

## Code of conduct

Bioconductor is built on the free and open exchange of scientific
ideas, and the contributions of our diverse user community. In this
spirit, EuroBioc 2018 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
conference experience for everyone. Harassment of any form (verbal,
physical, sexual, or other) will not be tolerated in talks, workshops, social activities, or online.

Reach out to conference organizers (bioceuro18@in.tum.de) or our on-site response team with any concern (Anne-Laure Boulesteix or Julien Gagneur).
