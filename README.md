## Accommodation
- [Motel One Munich-Sendlinger Tor](https://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/munich/hotel-munich-sendlinger-tor/). This is located in the city centre close to the Sendlinger Tor underground station.
- [Motel One Munich-Garching](https://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/munich/hotel-munich-garching/). This is located outside the city centre but closer to the conference venue. The Garching-Hochbruck station is right outside the hotel.

## Getting to the venue

By public transport (U-Bahn), the venue can be reached in approximately 30 minutes from the city centre. You need to get off at the last stop of the U6 Line (Garching-Forschungzentrum).

More information is available here

- [Ticket prices](https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/tickets-and-fares/tickets-daytickets/single-day-ticket/index.html). Garching-Forschungzentrum is on the green zone therefore you will need to buy the Munich XXL ticket (8,90 EUR for a single-day ticket).

## Social Activities

Wed. 5 Dec. evening. There will be a talk by [Lisa McShane](https://brb.nci.nih.gov/aboutBRP/lmcshane.htm) at Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) from 5-6pm, followed by a presentation of the [STRATOS](http://www.stratos-initiative.org) initiative. This is an opportunity for the two groups to meet. We plan to go for some beer and food downtown afterward (self-funded).

Thur. 6 Dec. evening we will visit the Christmas market in the city centre and have a dinner party (self-funded) at the brewery [Hofbrauhaus](https://www.hofbraeuhaus.de/en/) afterwards.

Sat. 8 Dec. If the snow condition allows it, some organizers will go skiing in Garmisch, a ski resort near Munich. Everyone is welcome to join. Here some information from last year about a [train & ski-pass offer](https://www.bahn.de/p/view/mdb/bahnintern/angebotsberatung/regio/laender-tickets/pdfs/2017/mdb_260597_garmischer_ski_ticket_2017_18_flyer.pdf).
