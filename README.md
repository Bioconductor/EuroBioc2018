## Social Activities

On the evening of 6 December, there will be a talk by Lisa McShane at Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) from 5-6pm. Afterwards, we will visit the Christmas market in the city centre and have a dinner party (self-funded) at a traditional Bavarian restaurant. We will post the meeting location closer to the date.

On Saturday (8 December), some attendees will go skiing in Garmisch, a Bavarian ski town outside Munich. Everyone is welcome to join. The meeting location will be at the Munich main station (Hauptbahnhof).
